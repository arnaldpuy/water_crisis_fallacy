# The water crisis narrative of the Global Commission on the Economics of Water lacks scientific rigor 

Arnald Puy & Bruce A. Lankford

This is the ``R`` code of the paper, whose abstract reads as follows:

*We examine the reports of the 2023 Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW), which claim that a global water crisis is underway because the world is above or near to its upper planetary boundary for water. We contend that they are flawed in two distinct ways: 1) a methodology and logical structure that fails to explain the utilization of planetary-scale boundaries and associated methods; and 2) substandard numeracy, including arithmetic errors and overstated numerical accuracy. We argue that the GCEW reports do not present solid evidence to infer an impending water emergency at a global scale. Our critique does not deny the existence of water imbalances across the globe, but questions the GCEW's understanding of water scarcity and the water cycle using the planetary boundaries concept. Because the GCEW’s reports lack scientific rigor, there are reasons to think that its priority is the furthering of the planetary boundaries’ framework and its related political and economical interests, rather than the exploration of all possible policy scenarios given our best water science available.*

The code reproduces all the analyses and the figures presented in the manuscript.
