# The water crisis narrative of the Global Commission on the Economics of Water lacks scientific rigor 

Arnald Puy & Bruce A. Lankford

This is the ``R`` code of the paper, whose abstract reads as follows:

*We examine the key reports of the 2023 Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW), which claim that a global water crisis is underway because the world is above or near to its upper planetary boundary for water. We contend that they are flawed in two distinct ways: 1) a methodology and logical structure that fails to explain the utilization of planetary boundaries and associated methods; and 2) substandard numeracy, including a lack of explanation, arithmetic errors, contradictions and overstated numerical accuracy. We argue that the GCEW reports do not present solid evidence to infer an impending water emergency at a global scale. Our critique does not deny the existence of global water imbalances, but questions the GCEW's understanding of water scarcity and the water cycle using the planetary boundaries concept. Because the GCEW lacks a credible research design, we conclude that the GCEW is a political project designed to sustain the narrative power of the planetary boundaries framework in order to benefit its further funding and influence.*

The code reproduces all the analyses and the figures presented in the manuscript.
