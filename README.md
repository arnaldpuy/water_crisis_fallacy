# Fallacies in the Global Water Crisis statistics

Arnald Puy & Bruce Lankford

*The 2023  Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW) report claims a global water cycle crisis and that the world is very near to its upper boundaries of water use. Here we audit the supporting numbers and reveal that this claim rests on arithmetic errors, contradictions and overstated numerical accuracy. On its own terms and statistics, the GCEW report does not allow to infer an impending water emergency. Our results do not deny the existence of important water imbalances between supply and demand, but question the efforts put by the GCEW in understanding the water cycle through the planetary boundaries concept. We argue that the GCEW resembles a political project designed to sustain the narrative power of the planetary boundaries framework and to generate further funding and influence.*
